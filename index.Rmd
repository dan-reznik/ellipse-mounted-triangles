# Introduction

The four classic triangle centers are (i) the incenter $X_1$ (where bisectors meet), (ii) the barycenter $X_2$ (the average of the vertices), (iii) the circumcenter $X_3$ (center of the circumscribing circle), and (iv) the orthocenter $X_4$ (where altitudes meet) [@mw]. The $X_k$ notation follows Kimberling's monumental Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers [@etc], where thousands of triangle centers and their properties are catalogued.

One prolific question is: what is the *locus* of some triangle center over some 1d *family* of triangles? The simplest family is perhaps one where two vertices are fixed (say, on the $x$ axis) and a third one moves parallel to it. Shown below are the loci of $X_i$, $i=1,2,3,4,20$ over such a family (see also this [video](https://youtu.be/Y50RFjhvsAo)):

```{r,out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/horiz P3.png")
```

One notices right away the loci of $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_4$, and $X_{20}$ meet on two specific points. Furthermore, the loci of $X_4$ and $X_{20}$ are parabolas! We leave these as an exercise.

Loci phenomena are a historical subject of study. Recent works include  [@dykstra2006-loci], [@odehnal2011-poristic], [@pamfilos2020-euler], [@sergei2016-com], but there are many many others.

Here we document some features of our evolving, interactive [locus visualization app](https://dan-reznik.github.io/ellipse-mounted-loci-p5js/). The figure below shows an example of three simultaneous, intricate loci. To see it live click [here](https://bit.ly/3h2wXZ1):

```{r,out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/X135 loci.png")
```

We were motivated by an intriguing construction for the [Right Strophoid Curve]([https://mathcurve.com/courbes2d.gb/strophoiddroite/strophoiddroite.shtml) [@odehnal2015-conics], on Robert Ferr√©ol's wonderful [Mathcurve](https://mathcurve.com/index.htm) portal: such a curve is the locus of the Orthocenter $X_4$ of a triangle with two stationary vertices $V_1,V_2$ and a 3rd one $P(t)$ which is slid along the circle centered on $V_1$ and of radius $r=|V_2-V_1|$:

```{r,out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/single_vtx_strophoid.svg")
```

In our app we consider a generalization: let $V_1,V_2$ be stationary with respect to an *ellipse* $\mathcal{E}$ with axes $a$ and $b$. Let a third vertex $P(t)$ slide along the boundary of $\mathcal{E}$. We can now trace out the loci of triangle centers such as the Incenter $X_1$, Barycenter $X_2$, Circumcenter $X_3$, etc., for different *mountings* of $V_1,V_2$ on $\mathcal{E}$. The $X_k$ notation follows Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers [@etc].

As an example, consider the locus (purple) of the Barycenter $X_2$ when $V_1,V_2$ are the right and top vertices of $\mathcal{E}$: 

```{r,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/single_vtx_example.svg")
```

Amazingly, for $V_1,V_2$ fixed anywhere (not necessarily on the boundary of $\mathcal{E}$), the locus of $X_2$ is, up to translation, an ellipse with axes $a/3$ and $b/3$ [@akopyan2007].

Courtesy of Peter Moses, the app can draw loci for the first 1000 Kimberling centers.

# Triangle families

The app can calculate and display loci of triangle centers, vertices, and envelopes (see below) over two basic types of triangle families: Poncelet and Mounted.

## Poncelet Families

A Poncelet family of triangles is inscribed in a first conic and circumscribed about a second one. Currently we assume these are both ellipses with the 2nd one contained within the 1st. The Poncelet pairs currently available include:

1. *billard*: the inner ellipse is confocal to the outer $(a,b)$;
1. *homothetic*: outer ellipse $(a,b)$ and inner ellipse has axes $(a/2,b/2)$
1. *incircle*: outer ellipse $(a,b)$ and inner circle with $r=(ab)/(a+b)$;
1. *inellipse*: an inner ellipse $(a,b)$ and outer circle with $R=a+b$;
1. *dual*: outer ellipse $(a,b)$ and inner ellipse $(a',b')$ where $b'=(a^2 b)/(a^2+b^2)$ and $a'={b'}(b/a)$.
1. *poristic*: the family discovered by William Chapple (1718-1781) in 1746 with fixed incircle (inradius $r$) and circumcircle (circumradius $R$), with $d=|{X_1}{X_3}|=\sqrt{R(R-2r)}$.
1. *brocard*: fixed circumcircle and inner Brocard inellipse [@mw], Brocard points are stationary and Brocard angle is invariant!

Except for the last, the above Poncelet families are illustrated below:

```{r,out.width="90%",background="white"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/0100_all_3.svg")
```

## Mounted Families

The app also provides triangle families $V_1 V_2 P(t)$, where $V_1,V_2$ are ``mounted'' (i.e., lie at stationary positions) with respect to an ellipse, and $P(t)=[a\cos{t},b\sin{t}]$ sweeps the boundary. The following 16 fixed locations for $V_1$ and $V_2$ are currently supported:

1. *major*: left and right ellipse vertices (EVs)
1. *minor*: top and bottom EVs
1. *mixed*: left and top EVs
1. *ctrMajor*: center and left EV
1. *ctrMinor*: center and top EV 
1. *fs*: the 2 foci
1. *fs-o*: center and right focus ($F_2$)
1. *fs-l*: left EV and $F_2$
1. *fs-r*: right EV and $F_2$
1. *fs-t*: top EV and $F_2$
1. *tl-bl*: top left corner of ellipse bounding box (TL) and bottom left of the same (BL)
1. *tl-tr*: TL and top right corner (TR) of ellipse bounding box
1. *tl-l*: TL and left EV
1. *tl-t*: TL and top EV
1. *tl-b*: TL and bottom EV
1. *tl-o*: TL and center of ellipse

As an example, below are loci of $X_{11}$ (purple) for each of the above:

```{r,out.width="90%",background="white"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/single_vtx_intro.svg")
```

# Types of Loci

Loci over the selected triangle family $T$ can be calculated for the following objects:

1. $X_n$: a triangle center of $T$ from $X_1--X_{1000}$
1. $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$: one of the vertices of $T$.
1. $env$: the envelope of segment $X_n X_m$, $m{\neq}n$.
1. $e_{12}$, $e_{23}$, $e_{31}$: the envelope of a given side of $T$.
1. The following Bicentric Pairs [@etc-bicentric]:
    + $\Omega_1,\Omega_2$: the Brocard points
    + $\beta_1,\beta_2$: the Beltrami points: inversions of Brocards wrt circumcircle
    + $\mu_1,\mu_2$: the hitherto-named ``Moses'' points: inversion of Brocards wrt incircle
    + $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$: the two foci of the Steiner circumellipse (aka. the Bickart points)

# Cevian-Type Triangles

One can also compute second-level cevian-like triangles with respect to a point $X_m$ of the reference or one of the above derived triangles. The available options are:

1. Cevian
1. Anticevian
1. Circumcevian
1. Pedal
1. Antipedal
1. Tripolar

# Associated circles

One is also able to superimpose a named circle (see list below) associated  with a triangle in the family under consideration. Furthermore one can also *invert* any triangle center with respect to the selected circle.

1. Circumcircle
1. Incircle
1. Brocard circle
1. etc.
